    <h1 style="text-align: center;" class="text-danger mt-3">ABOUT US</h1>
      <p class="ml-5 mt-3">As a company made up of musicians and music lovers, we're driven by our shared belief that music is the greatest unifying force in the world. And that idea fuels our mission to fill the world with music. To give people the tools they need to create and connect. To be seen and heard. And recently, to help and to heal. Music can stir the soul and change the frequency of the planet. So let's make some noise. Because the world needs to hear what you have to play.</p>
      <h2 class="text-info ml-5">History</h2>
      <p class="ml-5 mt-3">In 1959, as a world-changing, paradigm-shifting counterculture revolution was about to explode in America, Wayne Mitchell bought a small appliance and organ store in Hollywood, California. Seems like the end of the story, right? Not even close.</p>
      <h2 class="text-info ml-5 mt-3">Careers</h2>
      <p class="ml-5 mt-3">As a member of the Guitar Center family, you'll be part of the world's largest multi-channel musical instrument retailer. You'll also work in a positive, energetic atmosphere with others who are passionate about filling the world with music.</p>
